# Find Purines and Pyrimidines in DNA

Purines and pyrimidines are fundamental components of nucleotides in DNA and RNA and are essential for the storage of information in the cell. They also serve as a basic framework for coenzymes and are involved in numerous enzymatic processes. Alterations in purine or pyrimidine metabolism can have a variety of consequences. For example, disorders of purine metabolism lead to increased amounts of uric acid in blood and can result in gout. Nucleotide synthesis inhibitors are used in tumor therapy; ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, for instance, inhibits DNA replication in highly proliferative tumor cells by depriving the building blocks of DNA .



## Steps
* Step 1: Define the DNA Sequence



* Step 2: Count Purines (A and G)



* Step 3: Count Pyrimidines (C and T)


* Step 4: Calculate Percentage of Purines



* Step 5: Calculate Percentage of Pyrimidines
